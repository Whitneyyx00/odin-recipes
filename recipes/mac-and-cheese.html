    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>Macaroni and Cheese:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups of milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Breadcrumb Topping:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1:</b> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2:</b> Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add
            macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will
            finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3:</b> While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk
            in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Step 4:</b> Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in
            shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low
            heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if
            needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li><b>Step 5:</b> Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add
            bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese,
            then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
        <li><b>Step 6:</b> Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling,
            about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
